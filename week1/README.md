## Introduction:
- In week 1 we'll go through the basic building block of transformer architecture.
    - We will only learn the things that will be useful in implementing the transformer in practice.
- We'll also talk about the Generative AI Project Life Cycle.
    - This sections helps to plan out, how to build your own Generative AI Project.
    - Generative AI project Life Cycles walks you through the individual stages and decisions you have to make when you're developing Generative AI applications.
- You need to be able to decide whether you are performing pertraining and fine-tuning.
